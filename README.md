# Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Spatio-Temporal Human Action Recognition

## Overview
This project is a web-based attendance monitoring system that utilizes spatio-temporal human action recognition to track and log attendance. The system is designed to recognize and record the presence of individuals based on their actions and spatial positioning within a monitored area, such as a classroom or meeting room.

## Features
- **Real-Time Attendance Monitoring:** Tracks the presence of individuals in real-time.
- **Spatio-Temporal Human Action Recognition:** Recognizes human actions and spatial positions to accurately determine attendance.
- **Web-Based Interface:** User-friendly web interface for administrators and users to view attendance logs and system status.
- **Database Integration:** Stores attendance data in a robust database for future reference and reporting.
- **Notification System:** Sends alerts and notifications for attendance anomalies or important updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Spatio-Temporal Recognition:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- **WebRTC:** For real-time video streaming
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure access
